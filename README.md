## ⚙️ How It Works (The Pipeline)

1. User Input:
   The user enters a detailed query: "Looking for ISO 9001 certified aluminum 
   extrusion manufacturers in Southeast Asia capable of 50 tons/month."

2. Query Interpretation & Scraping (Apify):
   The system triggers an Apify actor to crawl industry directories, manufacturer 
   websites, and B2B portals for relevant raw data.

3. Data Processing (Gemini):
   The raw data from Apify is fed into Gemini. Gemini extracts 
   the structured data (company name, materials, compliance, contact info).

4. Scoring & Ranking:
   Gemini evaluates the extracted data against the user's original criteria, 
   assigning a match percentage/score to each supplier.

5. Presentation:
   The React frontend displays the top matches, allowing the user to filter, 
   compare, and export the supplier list.
